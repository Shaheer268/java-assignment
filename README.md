Practice questions for session 1
Question 1:
Write a program that prints the percentage marks of high school graduates by taking input
of sumof their obtained marks and Maximum marks.


Question 2:
Write a program that takes input of radius of circle and prints its circumference and area.

Question 3:
Discounted Selling price is to be calculated if original selling price and discount percentage
is given. Write a program to calculate and print discounted selling price of the user given
twoinputs (1) original selling price and (2) discounted selling price.

Question 4:
Write a program to calculate and print the original selling price if the discounted selling
price and discount percentage is entered by the user.

Question 5:
Watts is the measure of power consumption of electrical appliances. Which can be
calculated by using voltmeter and ammeter to read the voltage and ampere. Write a
program that prints the Watts against the user given volt and ampere reading.

Question 6:
Aquadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides
is called a trapezoid or trapezium.
The area K of a trapezoid is given by K = h * (a + b)/2,
where a andbarethelengths of the parallel sides, h
is the height (the perpendicular distance between
these sides). Write a program that takes input lengths
of two parallel sides and the perpendicular distance
between these two parallel lines, and prints the area
of this trapezoid. (Image Reference:

special cases. The orange figures also qualify as parallelograms.)

Question 7:
Anevennumberis aninteger of the form n=2k,where k is an integer. The even numbers
are therefore ...,-4,-2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …(REF:
https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EvenNumber.html
). While An odd number is an integer
of the form n=2k+1, where k is an integer. The odd numbers are therefore ...,-3,-1, 1, 3, 5,
7, … (REF: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OddNumber.html
). so for the purpose of
writing a computer program we can deduce that if, upon dividing a real integer number by
2 leaves one as remainder then that number will be called an odd number otherwise it is
an evennumber. Write a program that takes input an integer number and prints “EVEN” if
it is an even number and if it is an odd number than it prints “ODD”.

Question 8:
Area of a triangle can be calculated if lengths of
its three sides is known by using the Heron’s
formula which says that Square root of
(s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)) where s is half of the
perimeter of the triangle that can be calculated
by adding length of all the three sides and then
dividing it by 2.(for further information
